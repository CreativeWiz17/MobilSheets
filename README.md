## ï¿½ Getting Started

### Optical Music Recognition (OMR)

MobilSheets uses Audiveris for high-quality optical music recognition. The system can convert sheet music images into MusicXML format.

#### Using the Audiveris Script

The project includes a ready-to-use Audiveris setup with all required JAR files:

```bash
# Basic usage - convert image to MusicXML
./audiveris.sh -batch -export path/to/your/sheet-music.png

# Example with test image
./audiveris.sh -batch -export backend/uploads/testimage.png
```

**Output files:**
- `*.mxl` - MusicXML file (can be opened in MuseScore, Finale, etc.)
- `*.omr` - Audiveris project file (for further editing)

**Supported formats:**
- Input: PNG, JPG, TIFF, PDF
- Output: MusicXML (.mxl), Audiveris project (.omr)

#### Requirements
- Java 21+ (pre-installed in dev container)
- The `audiversejar/` folder contains all required runtime files
